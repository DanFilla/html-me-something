                    Gatlinburg is a beautiful town with many attractions. 
                    The Sugarlands Distilling co. is a great place to get some 
                    moonshine tasting in and to explore the strip. The Hollywood 
                    car museum and Ripley's believe it or not are must visit attractions.

                    The mountains in Gatlinburg are amazing. During our 
                    trip it was mostly sunny but when the rain came you 
                    could see the mountains "smoking". Both views were incredibly 
                    beautiful.

                    Hiking up the trails of the rocky mountains was a very unique experience. 
                    It was difficult because of the elevation changes,  TODO
                     After we were 
                    able to get past them the views of the waterfalls and creeks were 
                    spectacular.
