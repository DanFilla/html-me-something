                Gatlinburg is a beautiful town with many attractions. 
                The Sugarlands Distilling co. is a great place to get some 
                moonshine tasting in and to explore the strip. The Hollywood 
                car museum and Ripley's believe it or not are must visit attractions.

                The mountains in Gatlinburg are amazing. During our 
                trip it was mostly sunny but when the rain came you 
                could see the mountains "smoking". Both views were incredibly 
                beautiful.
